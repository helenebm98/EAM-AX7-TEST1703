# Workspaces

A workspace is an area in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations in which you can perform tasks and get overview of work in progress and completed tasks, which are related to the same work area or business process. The workspaces in Enterprise Asset Management are intended for planners, supervisors, or managers who work with managing requests and work orders in your company.

A workspace may contain various parts, for example buttons, tiles, and statistics (charts). In Enterprise Asset Management, the contents of a workspace may vary, but it may include the following sections:

#### Tiles and Buttons

Tiles are located in the left side of the screen in the **Summary** section. You may see tiles showing, for example, 'Active requests', which opens a list view to display data or tasks that are active / work in progress. If you point to a tile, you will see a small 'i' in a circle in the tile. Click on it to see information on when data was last updated and when the next automatic data update is due. Here, you can also click on a link to update data now.

In this section, you may also find a buttons for creating items relating to the workspace, for example 'Create request'.


#### List view

If a list view is presented, it displays active jobs or tasks related to the workspace.


#### Statistics (charts)

In the **Statistics** section, you find charts, for example, pie charts or bar charts, that visualize the data set up on the workspace. Point to a chart to see detailed information. If you click on a pie chart, the parts of the chart move slightly to let you see the size of each piece in the chart more clearly. Charts show live statistics. Point on the chart to see detailed information.


#### Power BI integration

If you have a Power BI integration subscription, you can see an overview of the tiles available for all workspaces in Enterprise Asset Management. If required, you can select more tiles to be shown in the **Power BI** section of the workspace. When you click on a Power BI tile, you open the Power BI website. The tiles available in Power BI show historical data.

#### Power BI

If required, you can add Power BI tiles to your request management workspace, for example:

- Average closing age, showing average age of requests when they are no longer active, meaning they have been rejected or closed, or the related work order has been completed.

- Number of new, active, and closed requests per day, displayed in three colors. This view does not inform you how many new or active requests have been closed. This view provides historical data from the latest 2-week period.
