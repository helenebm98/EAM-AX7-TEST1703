# Quotation

Quotations can be created from a work order. For example, a customer requests a quote for a maintenance job, which is not covered by a service contract. In that case, you first create a work order and subsequently create a quotation, which is sent to the customer. Quotations can only be created on objects for which a customer account has been selected.

### Create and Confirm Quotation

**Enterprise Asset Management** uses project quotation in the **Project management and accounting** module to create project quotations. You create quotations in **All work orders**. First, you create a work order, which is described in the [Introduction to Work Orders](08_Work_Orders.md#introduction-to-work-orders) and [Manually Created Work Orders](08_Work_Orders.md#manually-created-work-orders) sections. The work order for which you want to create a quotation must contain forecasts. Next step is to create a quotation. If required, you can also update a quotation that has not yet been confirmed. Finally, when you get approval from the customer, you confirm the quotation.
