# Invoicing

When you have registered consumption on a customer work order, next step is to invoice the customer. Invoice processing is done in the **Project management and accounting** module. You can include one or several projects in one invoice.

Whether you are able to create an invoice proposal for a work order depends on the work order stage selected for the work order. A work order stage is connected to a project stage. Project stages rules are set up for project stages, and the rules define which tasks you are allowed to carry out at a specific project stage, including creating invoice proposals and journals.

Click **Project management and accounting** > **Setup** > **Project management and accounting parameters** > **Project stage** > select a stage > click **Project stage rules** to verify that creating invoice proposals is allowed for that project stage.

Refer to the [Work Order Stages](08_Work_Orders.md#work-order-stages) section for more information on work order stages and stage groups.

### Create Invoice Proposal

1. Click **Enterprise asset management** > **Common** > **Work orders** > **All work orders** or **Active work orders**.
2. Select the work order for which you want to create an invoice proposal.

3. On the **General** tab > **New** group, click **Invoice proposal**.
4. Fill out the **Create invoice proposal** drop-down. You can select project contract, project and dates, as well as the specific transactions to be included in the proposal.

###### NOTE
The procedure for invoicing work orders related to contracts is the same as with invoicing service jobs, as described above.
When you invoice installments and other costs related to a contract, that is done in **Project management and accounting parameters** > **Project invoices** > **Project invoice proposals**.
